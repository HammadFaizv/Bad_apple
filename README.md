## but on a terminal and using ascii characters

Its just a free time project and I don't have a reason to build this.

## Thought Process
1. Download the mp4 file.
2. Extract frames from the video using cv2 videoCapture and save these frames in a folder. (I did not upload the Frames folder as it has more than 6000 images but u get the point)
3. Convert these frames or images into ascii characters and save them. This is in correspondance to my previous code how to convert image to ascii characters: 'https://github.com/HammadFaizv/image_to_special_charecters' (I haven't uploaded this folder either)
4. Now we just read each file in the folder and print its content on the console and clear the console each time after we read a new file.

# Note
Its not the best way to do this there is even time latency between real video and the final result as you will see. Its not like I cannot solve the issue buts it's more about my mood.
I leave this problem to my future self.
